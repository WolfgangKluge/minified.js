They are fantastic libraries and I really like to use them, but they contain about 90kB of code even after compilation. This code needs to be parsed and executed on every page that you include them on. For me, that just feels too large for what that they offer, and especially for what I need. The 30kB that remain after gzipping can also cause a significant delay on low-bandwidth networks.</p> <p>In the last years I worked on some personal projects (<a href="http://jarfiller.com">jarfiller.com</a> is the only one that has been published), and when I work on them, I usually try to make everything perfect. That means that I try to optimize the pages, make them as small as possible, and then every kilobyte hurts. So instead of using jQuery, I started writing my own little helper functions to replace jQuery functionality without the overhead. As I worked on several other projects, I wrote more and more helper functions and started sharing them between projects until they became a library of their own. By now they are so mature that I believe that this library, called Minified, has become a valid alternative to jQuery and MooTools at a fraction of the size.</p> <p>What you see here is only the beginning, a 4kB module for building web sites. The plan is to have three modules, each under 4kB: <ul><li><strong>Minified Web</strong> is a browser interaction library, comparable to jQuery or MooTools. It is available now.</li> <li><strong>Minified Util</strong> offers utilities for lists and maps, functions, promises, string and number formatting, date handling and internationalization. Its scope and size can be compared to <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a>, but it omits the more obscure functional helpers and replaces them with date and string helpers. You can find an early version in the /src directory on GitHub.</li> <li><strong>Minified App</strong> will be a MVC-oriented library for single-page applications and complex multi-page apps. The scope will be somewhat similar to Backbone or Angular.js, but with a Plain-Old-JSON-Object (POJO) principles and a template/binding concept that is closely tied to the page's DOM and is well prepared for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/#template-section">HTML5 templates</a>. It is built upon the other two modules. A preview should be available by the end of 2013.</li> </ul> </p> <p style="margin-top: 1.5em">Thank you for your interest in Minified! <div style="margin-left: 8em; margin-top: 1em; display: inline-block;"> <div> <!--[if lte IE 8]><img src='/img/signature.png' alt="Tim Jansen"><![endif]--> <!--[if gt IE 8]><img src='/img/signature.svg' alt="Tim Jansen"><![endif]--> <!--[if !IE]>--><img src='/img/signature.svg' alt="Tim Jansen"/><!--<![endif]--> </div> <div style=" font-size: 7pt;text-align: center">Tim Jansen</div> </div> </p> </div> </div></div><div id="foot"><div class="container"><p>Please send feedback to <a href="mailto:tim@tjansen.de">tim@tjansen.de</a>.
